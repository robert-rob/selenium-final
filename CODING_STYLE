Code Guidelines

Try to follow the style of the existing code.

Limit Lines of Code to 120 characters.

Try to limit Class Files to 300 lines of code.

Write clean, modular code. Use the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).
This makes the code easier to maintain and prolongs its usefulness.

Create modules such as HomePage for methods that interact with the HomePage etc.

Always write a JavaDoc comment above each method explaining it.

Do not comment out code for later use. Use version code or branches for that.

Avoid using a wait inside a test method. Insert it in a helper method instead.

Starting Method Curly Brackets should not have their own line ie. "public static void methodName() { ...".

Variables placed before methods in a class.

Private methods placed before public methods in a class.

Use the StringRef file for Strings whenever possible. Avoid Hardcoding Strings.
